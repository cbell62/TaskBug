Task Management System

Scenarios
•	Rob became a manager of a small computer repair shop chain in Orlando, called I-Fix-It. He also just hired 14 new employees, from that 14 employees, 7 of them will be working on a management system that could categorize the devices that come in that need to be repaired by the area of expertise that they are needed in. The point of making an in house system, for Rob, is that this would incentivize the employees into making a product that is widely used for the chain stores, they can initialize it in a way that it can be a stand alone product, and it would keep the chain more organized and efficient. As the manager of the chain, Rob wants to be able to check in with every store and see how many and how much of repairs that they must do in a single day. With this software, Rob can see the growing trend of technology needing to be repaired or he can see what technology gets more repaired and thus cater to that audience.
•	Bob is a store manager of a Harris Teeter in Charlotte. Since Harris Teeter is a big grocery store, they have a lot of inventory that they must organize. Bob has asked corporate for 4 software engineers that they might have to come to the store and talk with him about a management software for groceries. This software will assign tasks to certain employees in the store that work in specific isles, to take inventory and see what they need. For example, Bob must work the isles with spices and energy drinks. Since Monster energy is a very popular energy drink, it is out of stock sometimes in the isle. Bob would report this to the task managing system and thus the system will make a task for Bob later to order more Monster drinks, since he is the store manager.
•	Lynn is a lead software developer at Google and is fed up with the menial task management devices that she uses in order to keep her team and her on time. She struggles with staying on time as it is and working in a team is not beneficial to her ever-growing laundry list of work that she must complete. So, she must have a management system that keeps track of what her team is doing and what she is doing. Lynn and her team work on the security development of google, so their job is very valuable, and they must stay on time. The management system must hand out tasks of security development to all the employees and must keep them on time for submission to Lynn. Lynn also wants to make this a competition for the developers in her team in order to make the most out of their work and the developers get a raise if their work is found to be immaculate. Thus, there needs to be a ranking system that must be in the management system.
