                                                Design Sprint Day 1
Scenarios
- Ace is a college senior in Dallas, at a private university, majoring in English. He in is his
advanced English Literature class and has just been informed of a class project that 
will be focused on different periods of literature, the impact of them on modern day 
literature, how it was used and the impact of it on that time period. 

Each group is required to split up the work and to work together and collaborate
in order to get this project done successfully. Each person in the group is required
to do their own portion and contribute to the group equally and pull their own weight.
Due to this, Ace suggests that the group uses Task Management Software Service for 
the project. This Task Management Software Service would be in place so that each 
group member could be assigned their own tasks that they need to do for the project, 
set remainders and notifications for their tasks, allow them to be able to see the progress 
of each member. In addition, each member when a task is done will have the option to upload
their work when they mark the task as done so that each team member can not only see that 
one of them has completed the task, but they can see not only the work, but the quality of it as well. 
There will even be a section below each task done for feedback so everyone can get feedback
on the work they have done, know how to do it better next time, and can be commended 
on a job well done. 

The Task Management Software Service will help to make sure the work is split up, 
that everyone in the group collaborates with one another, that each person pulls their 
own weight, does their own portion, and contribute to the group equally. 

- Jennifer works for a software firm, in Sweden where she leads a team of eight 
programmers. She has decided that there has to be some software where there can be 
communication and help her to time manage her team better than she currently is. She 
is looking for a software where she can know how many hours each person puts in, where 
each person can ask for help and other people can help when problems arises. She wishes
for a software where the programamers can create tasks that they need to do and show 
progress and where they are currently at. She wants to be able to add and remove 
people as she wishes and be able to manage her entire team. 

Jennifer sends an email out to a software company workers' group to see if anyone can
recommend an appropriate system. Two people reply and both suggest that she uses the
Task Management Software Service, a software that would allow her to be the 
adminstrator of the group and be able to manage her team. As she has never used the
Task Management Software Service before, she sets up an adminstrator account and
an account for employees with the Task Management Software Service. 
 
She logs in to it and sees herself as an administrator, showing that she has control to add, 
delete, and modify users (employees), group boards filled with work, and even comments. She gets a 
board set up so that each user can immediately start working and begin documentation
of tasks and progress once they log in.
