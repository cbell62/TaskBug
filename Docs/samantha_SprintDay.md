Scenarios and user stories:

As a leader of a team I would like to know when someone is stuck and needs assistance
I would like to be able to keep track of progress and know when someone’s work has been checked
I would like to be able to easily tell when something is complete or in progress
I would like to know how much time it takes members to complete a task
I would like to know the percentage total of work distributed among team members
I would like to be able to get and receive notifications when something changes

As a user of the task managing software the application the software enables the users to assign 
tasks and clearly determine the progress the task is at. As A user of the software the 
application s able to determine the time it takes a member to complete a task. This is helpful 
for estimating project costs to clients and determining hourly wages. (Although, hourly wages 
do not reward efficiency) As a user of the software notifications are helpful for reminding 
someone when a task is assigned and when others are in need of assistance. This will help keep 
the project moving smoothly. If a person needs assistance, we need a way to assign someone to 
look it over if there are no volunteers after a short period of time. The ability to have someone 
look over other code will help prevent overlooked errors with everyone working remotely.
